SGPushNotificationSimulator

The purpose of SGPushNotificationSimulator is to simulate receiving a push notification from your app's server backend.

Implementation is very easy.  Simply drop the following files into your XCode project:

SGPushNotificationSimulator.h
SGPushNotificationSimulator.m

SGPushNotificationSimulator supports virtually any push notification message that your application uses.  To do this you simply save the push notification parameters into a plist file.

For each notification create a plist file using the name of the notification you wish to test.

Example:

test-notification.plist

Contents:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
        <key>userInfo</key>
        <dict>
                <key>aps</key>
                <dict>
                        <key>alert</key>
                        <string>This is our test push notification.</string>
                        <key>sound</key>
                        <string>default</string>
                </dict>
                <key>custom</key>
                <string>You can put custom entries in this dictionary that match the APN attributes your server sends.</string>
        </dict>
</dict>
</plist>


The aps dictionary contains the alert message and sound information to present a UIAlertView.  This is required by Apple and the aps key is reserved.

You can then add the custom key/values to the plist that your application uses to act upon the push notification.


# Testing the notification

Simply import SGPushNotificationSimulator.h into the .m file your going to call it from.

Call the following:

[SGPushNotificationSimulator simulatePushNotificationWithName:@"test-notification"];

"test-notification" is the same as the name we used when creating the .plist file.
